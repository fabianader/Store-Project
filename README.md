# Store Project
ASP.NET Core MVC Modular E-Commerce App (In Progress)

# Overview
Store Project is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application structured using the Feature Folder Architecture (modular pattern). This project is built with scalability and maintainability in mind, making it suitable for medium to large-sized web applications.

The goal is to build a modern, extensible online store using:

- ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8)

- ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication

- Clean architecture practices (DTOs, services, etc.)

- Modals and SweetAlert2 for dynamic admin UX

- HTML5-based admin and front-end templates

- The project is currently under development.

# Features
#### ‚úÖ Modular Feature Folder Structure
Each domain (User, Product, Category, etc.) is separated into its own folder with its own controllers, services, views, models, and DTOs.

#### ‚úÖ ASP.NET Core Identity Integration
Secure user authentication and role management via Identity.

#### ‚úÖ DTO-based Input/Output Models
All data passed between UI and logic layers are secured and shaped via Data Transfer Objects.

#### ‚úÖ Admin Area
   - User management via modals and SweetAlert2
   - Layouts and partial views optimized for reusability
   - HTML-based AdminLTE UI templates

#### ‚úÖ Responsive Front-End
The UI uses responsive HTML5/CSS3 templates for the public-facing store.

#### üîí Validation & Security
   - Email validation attribute
   - Anti-forgery protection
   - Secure password reset workflows

#### üì¶ Entity & Domain Models
Users, Products, Orders, Carts, Categories, Posts, Messages, etc.

#### üóÇÔ∏è Architecture & Structure
The solution follows a clean separation of concerns via:
   - `Features/` (modular areas)
   - `Entities/` (domain models)
   - `DTOs/` (for secure communication)
   - `Common/` (shared helpers, services, attributes)
   - `Infrastructure/Data/` (DbContext, initializers, EF migrations)
   - `wwwroot/` (static assets: JS, CSS, images)
